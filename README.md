# bzs-chess
The Tech Stack for this project is NextJS with ChakraUI. To run the project, open the `bzs-chess` folder in Visual Studio Code. 
In the terminal at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, ensure that your active folder is `C:<your user's path>/source/repos/bzs-chess/src`. You may have to type `cd bzs-chess` to change your directory to the 2nd `bzs-chess folder nested inside the repo's main folder. Once you've done this, execute the following commands in the terminal (in this order).

1.) `npm install`
2.) `npm run dev`

This should allow you to view the website at `localhost:3000`. Happy Coding!
